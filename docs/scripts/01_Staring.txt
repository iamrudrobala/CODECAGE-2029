**\[Scene: Walking home from school | Late Afternoon]**

You walk alone, your backpack slightly heavy from the day's books. The sky is turning orange. The neighborhood is quiet — almost too quiet.

Suddenly, you hear it.

*A soft engine purrs behind you.*

> *...A car?*

You glance over your shoulder.

A black car. Sleek. Windows tinted so dark, you can’t see the driver. It's moving slowly… matching your pace.

> *Why is he following me...?*

You try to stay calm and keep walking, a little faster this time.

But the car speeds up too.

> *Nope. Not a coincidence.*

You break into a light jog, pretending not to panic.

*SCREECH!*

The car swerves ahead and stops — cutting you off.

The door swings open.

A man steps out. Black gloves. Long coat. You can’t see his face clearly, but he’s walking toward you fast.

**→ What do you do?**

* \[Run]
* \[Shout for help]
* \[Freeze]

*(If player chooses \[Run]):*
You turn and sprint. Your feet pound the pavement. You don’t look back—
But he’s faster.

You’re tackled from behind.

"Got you," the man mutters, pinning you down.

> *Who IS this guy?!*

He pulls out something metallic… small… like a pen. But it hisses.

> *Wait... an injection?!*

You thrash, but it’s too late.

*PSSHT!*

The needle stabs into your neck.

> *W-what… is this...? Why can’t I move... everything’s... blurry...*

Your limbs go numb. Your vision fades.

The last thing you hear is the car door slamming shut.

**\[You black out.]**

---
If the player chooses [Shout for help]:
You turn around and scream at the top of your lungs.

"HELP! SOMEBODY HELP ME!!"

Your voice echoes through the empty street...

But no one answers.

Where is everyone?!

The man steps out of the car calmly, almost annoyed. He pulls something from his coat — the same small metallic injector.

"Why do they always scream first?"

Wait—what?

He lunges. You try to run now, but he’s too close. His hand covers your mouth.

You struggle violently.

PSSHT!

The injector hisses into your neck.

Your scream dies in your throat.

I can't... move... my eyes... are so heavy...

You collapse.

[You black out.]

If the player chooses [Freeze]:
Your body locks up. You want to run, scream, anything — but you can’t.

Move. MOVE!

The man steps closer, footsteps echoing.

He doesn’t speak.

Just walks straight up to you.

You’re frozen in place — a deer in headlights.

He raises a strange device in his hand.

You open your mouth to scream.

Too late.

PSSHT!

The injection pierces your neck like a dart.

Wh-what...? My legs... they're gone...

Your knees buckle.

Darkness swallows your vision.

[You black out.]
