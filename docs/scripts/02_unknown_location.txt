### **\[Scene: ??? | Unknown Location]**

You wake up.

Your head is spinning. Your limbs feel heavy, like you’ve been asleep for days.

The room is dark. Cold. Metallic.

No windows. No doors.

Just a solid concrete floor and four black walls.

> *Where... am I?*

You try to sit up. Your body aches. There's a low humming sound, like something... alive.

Suddenly—

*CLANK!*

The wall in front of you glows faintly—then splits open with a mechanical hiss.

A massive screen slides out, filling the entire wall.

Static.

Then… a face appears.

Or... is it a face?

Its features are human-like but wrong. Too smooth. Too symmetrical. Too... perfect.

Its eyes don’t blink.

**\[MONITOR]:**
"Welcome, Rudro."

You freeze.

> *How does it know my name?*

**\[MONITOR]:**
"You are one of the main contestants here."

> *Contestant...? What kind of game is this?*

**\[MONITOR]:**
"But you’re not alone."

*Click.*
The screen shifts.

Thirteen smaller windows appear — each showing a different room. Each room… has someone else.

Some are unconscious. Some are pacing. One is screaming. Another is just staring at the camera, eyes hollow.

**\[MONITOR]:**
"These are our other collections."

It pauses.

As if watching your reaction.

Then the screen flickers back to that unsettling face.

**\[MONITOR]:**
"Take your rest. See you later."

*Click.*

The screen goes black.

Silence.

You’re alone again.
