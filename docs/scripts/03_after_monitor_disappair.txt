### **\[Scene: Just after the AI screen disappears]**

You hear a *clunk*. A hidden door slides open behind you.

Two guards step in. Black uniforms. Helmets. You can’t see their faces — only the shining metal of their tasers.

One of them speaks in a flat voice:

**\[Guard]:**
“Get up. Come with us.”

> *What the hell is going on? Are they taking me somewhere else?*

---

**→ What do you do?**

1. \[Try to fight the guard]
2. \[Stay calm and follow them]

---

### **If player chooses \[1. Try to fight the guard]:**

You clench your fists and leap forward.

**\[You]:**
“LIKE HELL I’M GOING ANYWHERE WITH YOU!”

You swing at the nearest guard.

But before your punch lands—

*ZAP!*

You’re hit with a high-voltage shock.

Everything goes white.

---

### **\[Scene resumes in the same room as Choice 2, after waking up]**

You wake up — again.

But this time... in a completely different place.

A **beautiful room.** Soft bed. Warm lighting. A tray of delicious food beside you. Clean clothes folded neatly.

> *Wait... this is... nice?*

A small speaker on the wall crackles.

**\[AI Voice - same one from earlier]:**
"Welcome again, Rudro. A rough start, but you're here now."

---

### **If player chooses \[2. Stay calm and follow them]:**

You swallow your fear and nod.

> *No point in rushing things... let’s see where this leads.*

The guards escort you through a long metallic hallway. Strangely quiet.

A door opens — and inside is a **beautiful room.**

Comfortable bed. Warm lighting. Good food.

> *They’re… treating me well?*

**\[AI Voice]:**
"Smart choice. Welcome, Rudro. You’ll need your strength soon."

---

### **Next Options (after player explores room or eats):**

Time passes. You’ve rested, eaten. But questions keep burning in your mind.

A guard finally appears at your door.

He stands silently, watching.

**→ What do you do now?**

1. \[Ask the guard what's going on]
2. \[Say nothing and wait]

---

### **If player chooses \[2. Wait]:**

You stay silent. Just watching. Waiting.

Minutes pass.

Then hours.

No one comes back.

You grow restless. Hungry again. The silence is loud.

Eventually, the guard returns.

You can’t take it anymore.

**\[You]:**
“Hey! What is this place?! What do you want from me?!”

He stares at you through his visor.

And finally responds:

**\[Guard]:**
“You’ll find out. Soon.”
